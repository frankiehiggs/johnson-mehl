    "\n",
    "This is the bit using Moulinec's method. Moulinec has two separate steps: first assigning the pixels which are covered by time $T$, then the pixels which were not covered by time $T$. He chooses $T$ to optimise the speed of the algorithm. We can simplify the algorithm by choosing $T$ to be at least the coverage time, then there is no second step. That's a little bit slower than choosing the optimal $T$, but since we have a decent upper bound on $T$ it's not too bad.\n",

    "The algorithm works as follows: we start with an array $\\mathcal{D}$ of \"running minimum coverage times\" and an array $\\mathcal{I}$ of assignments, both the same shape as the output image. We intialise $\\mathcal{D}$ to be full of $\\infty$. We order the seeds $x_1, \\dots, x_N$ with corresponding arrival times $t_1, \\dots, t_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for each $i = 1, \\dots, N$ in turn: for every pixel $y$ in the ball centred at $x_i$ of radius $T-t_i$, this pixel was first reached by seed $i$ at time $\\| x_i - y \\| + t_i$. If $\\| x_i - y \\| + t_i < \\mathcal{D}(y)$, then we set $\\mathcal{I}(y) = i$ (overwriting its previous value if it had one) and set the new running minimum $\\mathcal{D}(y) = \\| x_i - y \\| + t_i$.\n",
