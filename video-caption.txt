Description for Youtube:

Coverage by discs with heavy-tailed random radii

Place N points uniformly at random in the square of side length 1.
For each point x_i, choose a random growth rate Y_i, where the Ys are independent
and identically distributed according to a heavy-tailed distribution.
Then grow discs centred at each of your N points,
with the disc centred at x_i growing at rate Y_i.
Wait until the discs cover all of the square,
and colour each point according to which disc first reached it.

If the distribution of Y_i is extremely heavy-tailed then one of the growth rates
is so much bigger than the rest that the majority of the square is covered by a single disc.

In the video we start with a Pareto distribution with shape parameter 3,
so it has 2.99th moments, but not 3rd moments. This is somewhat heavy-tailed,
but we can see from the video that there is no single disc covering most of the square.
Then as the video progresses we make the distribution more and more heavy-tailed,
until the second moment is infinity, then the first moment, and we end with shape
parameter around 0.2, when one disc covers almost everything.

Remark for the paper on the Pareto radii:

A series of videos demonstrating Theorem~\ref{RANDOMRADII}
can be viewed at \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaV5rk6Gk7qEXpLOU7FSvN4b8dy1_GJn}.
In the video, each frame is a picture of $[0,1]^2$
with each $x \in [0,1]^2$ assigned a colour
based on $\argmin_i \inf\{t \geq 0 : x \in B(p_i,t Y_i)\}$.
FIX NOTATION
The $Y_i$s are Pareto distributed, so have a heavy tail.
As the video progresses, the tail becomes heavier,
with the growth rates in subsequent frames coupled
so that the $Y_i$s change continuously.
It starts when $\E[Y_i^3] = \infty$
but $\E[Y_i^{3-\varepsilon}] < \infty$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$
(this meets the conditions of Theorem~\ref{RANDOMRADII}),
and gradually reduces the number of finite moments,
finishing when $\E[Y_i^{0.2}] = \infty$.

The video after the point where $\E[Y_i^2] = \infty$
illustrates the remark made AT SOME POINT,
and shows that even when second moments do not exist,
the restricted coverage model can have an interesting structure,
with multiple discs covering large areas,
but no single enormous disc covering most of $[0,1]^2$,
apart from when $Y_i$ is extremely heavy-tailed.

CHECK THIS IS TRUE FOR VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF POINTS;
I CAN GENERATE SINGLE FRAMES WHEN a=2 (AND a=1)
TO CHECK.
