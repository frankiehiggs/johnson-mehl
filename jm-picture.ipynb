    "# Johnson-Mehl tessellation picture\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to draw a picture of the Johnson-Mehl tessellation and a Voronoi tessellation so the viewer can compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting fact which I hadn't realised until trying to draw these pictures: the boundaries between cells in the JM tessellation _aren't straight_.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are algorithms and useful data structures for Voronoi tessellations in the [book by Okabe, Boots, Sugihara and Chiu](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470317013). I've used the algorithm described by Moulinec in [\"A simple and fast algorithm for computing discrete Voronoi, Johnson-Mehl or Laguerre diagrams of points\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965997822000618). Mainly because it's simple, although being fast is also an advantage."

    "2. Assign each pixel in an image to its appropriate cell, based on which Johnson-Mehl seed grows to cover it first.\n",
    "3. Compute adjacency: I want to know which cells border each other so I can colour them appropriately.\n",
    "4. Colour the cells nicely. It's a planar map, so a four-colouring exists, but I think I'll be a bit simpler and use a greedy colouring, so no two neighbouring cells share a colour but maybe the number of colours isn't completely optimal."

    "### Assigning pixels to their cells\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the bit using Moulinec's method. Moulinec has two separate steps: first assigning the pixels which are covered by time $T$, then the pixels which were not covered by time $T$. He chooses $T$ to optimise the speed of the algorithm. We can simplify the algorithm by choosing $T$ to be the coverage time, then there is no second step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows: we start with an array $\\mathcal{D}$ of \"running minimum coverage times\" and an array $\\mathcal{I}$ of assignments, both the same shape as the output image. We intialise $\\mathcal{D}$ to be full of $\\infty$. We order the seeds $x_1, \\dots, x_N$ with corresponding arrival times $t_1, \\dots, t_N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for each $i = 1, \\dots, N$ in turn: for every pixel $y$ in the ball centred at $x_i$ of radius $T-t_i$, this pixel was first reached by seed $i$ at time $\\| x_i - y \\| + t_i$. If $\\| x_i - y \\| + t_i < \\mathcal{D}(y)$, then we set $\\mathcal{I}(y) = i$ (overwriting its previous value if it had one) and set $\\mathcal{D}(y) = \\| x_i - y \\| + t_i$.\n",

This might be a little slow, but I'm not worried about fast performance; I only plan to use this code to make pretty diagrams, so won't have more than a few hundred cells (probably fewer). As long as the resolution is high enough this will, with high probability, give us the correct adjacency structure."
